htmlcxx - html and css APIs for C++


Description

htmlcxx is a simple non-validating html and css1 parser for C++.
Although there are several other html parsers available, htmlcxx has some
characteristics that make it unique:

- STL like navigation of DOM tree, using excelent's tree.hh library from Kasper Peeters
- It is possible to reproduce exactly, character by character, the original document from the parse tree
- Bundled css parser
- Optional parsing of attributes	
- C++ code that looks like C++ (not so true anymore)
- Offsets of tags/elements in the original document are stored in the nodes of the DOM tree

The parsing politics of htmlcxx are very simple, and almost no effort is done
to correct invalid html. The focus of the library is not speed, but it is
fast enough for most needs.

News for version 0.4

The DOM tree building behavior of htmlcxx now tries to mimic Mozilla Firefox parser. Added code to deal with uri parsing. The code is much faster. True API documentation will be available in the next version! By now, take a look at the htmlcxx sample application.

Examples

Using htmlcxx is quite simple. Take a look
at this example.


  #include <htmlcxx/html/parser.h>
  ...
  
  //Parse some html code
  string html = "<html><body>hey</body></html>";
  HTML::Parser parser;
  tree<HTML::Node> dom = parser.parse(html);
  
  //Print DOM tree
  cout << dom << endl;


The htmlcxx application

htmlcxx is the name of both the library and the utility
application that comes with this package. Although the 
htmlcxx (the application) is mostly useless for programming, you can use it 
to easily see how htmlcxx (the library) would parse your html code
Just install and try htmlcxx -h.

License Stuff

 Code is now under the LGPL. This was our initial intention, and is now possible thanks to the author of tree.hh, that allowed us to use it under LGPL only for HTML::Node template instances. Check http://www.fsf.org or the COPYING file in the distribution for details about the LGPL license. The uri parsing code is a derivative work of Apache web server uri parsing routines.
